# Diamond-sweeper-task

I have completed the first level of the game where the user can start the game and as soon as all the diamonds are found, The game ends and the score is shown on the swal alert message.

I have used plain javascript and Jquery and I have implemented some styling for the board. I have used sweet alert js library in order to show the score of the remaining box that are unturned.

You can start the app as usual in npm as follows: 
1. npm install
2. npm run compile
3. npm start
